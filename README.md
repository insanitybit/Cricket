# Cricket
Cricket is a harness for AFL, currently built in rust (see /old/ for NodeJS).

Cricket's purpose is to provide a harness for distributing instances of AFL in
a network.

Currently, this harness is partially implemented. An api is exposed that will
let a caller execcute AFL instances on a remote host, get the current stats,
send the queue to a another system.
